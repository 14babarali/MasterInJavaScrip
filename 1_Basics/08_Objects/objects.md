# Objects in JavaScript

## Introduction
Objects are variables that can contain many values. They are used for storing keyed collections of data.

## Creating an Object
An object can be created using curly braces `{}` and defining key-value pairs.
```javascript
let person = {
    name: "John",
    age: 30,
    city: "New York"
};
