# Functions in JavaScript

## Introduction
Functions are blocks of code designed to perform a particular task. They are executed when they are called (invoked).

## Function Declaration
A function is defined using the `function` keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses `()`. The code to be executed is placed inside curly brackets `{}`.
```javascript
function functionName(parameters) {
    // code to be executed
}
