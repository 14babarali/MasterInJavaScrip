# Arrays in JavaScript

## Introduction
Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable. An array is a special variable that can hold more than one value at a time.

## Creating an Array
An array can be created using square brackets `[]` or the `Array` constructor.
```javascript
let array1 = [];
let array2 = [1, 2, 3];
let array3 = new Array(1, 2, 3);
