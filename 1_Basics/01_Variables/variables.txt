Step 4: Explanation and Practice
Now, let's go through the explanation and practice together.

Introduction to Variables
Variables in JavaScript are used to store data that can be manipulated and retrieved later. Depending on how we want to use a variable, we can choose between var, let, and const.

var
Function Scoped: This means that a variable declared with var is available within the function it is declared.
Re-declaration and Update: You can re-declare and update a var variable.
Hoisting: var variables are hoisted to the top of their scope, meaning they can be used before they are declared, but they will be undefined.
let
Block Scoped: This means that a variable declared with let is only available within the block (e.g., { ... }) it is declared.
Re-declaration: You cannot re-declare a let variable in the same scope.
Update: You can update a let variable.
Hoisting: let variables are hoisted to the top of their block but are not initialized.
const
Block Scoped: Similar to let, const is also block scoped.
Re-declaration and Update: You cannot re-declare or update a const variable once it has been assigned a value.
Hoisting: const variables are hoisted to the top of their block but are not initialized.
Practice
Open your variables.js file in VS Code.
Run the file using Node.js (or in the browser console if you prefer).
