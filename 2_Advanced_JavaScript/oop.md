# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in JavaScript

## Introduction
Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data and code. JavaScript, although primarily a prototype-based language, supports OOP concepts such as classes, objects, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.

## Classes and Objects
In JavaScript, classes provide a blueprint for creating objects. Objects are instances of classes.

## Inheritance
Inheritance allows a class (subclass) to inherit properties and methods from another class (superclass).

## Encapsulation
Encapsulation is the bundling of data (properties) and methods that operate on the data within a single unit (class).

## Polymorphism
Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables methods to do different things based on the object that it is acting upon.
